Define function while_test with parameters number x, number y:
  Display "While Testing"
  Create a variable named result with value 0
  
  Display "While result == 0"

    Display "result = ", result

  Display "While result <= 10"
  while result is less than or equal to 10:
    Add result and 1, store into result
    Display "result = ", result

  Display "While result != -10"
  while result is not equal to -10:
    Subtract 1 from result, store into result
    Display "result = ", result

  Display "Setting result to ", result, " * ", "100"
  Multiply result and 100, store into result
  Display "While result >= 100"
  while result is greater than or equal to 100:
    Divide result by 10, store into result
